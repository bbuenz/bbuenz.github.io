<h2>Researcher</h2>
I'm a second-year PhD student at Stanford University in [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo)'s [Applied Cryptography Group](https://crypto.stanford.edu). In my research I generally focus on the crypto(graphy) of crypto(currencies). I've worked on proofs of solvencies, randomness beacons, light clients, confidential transactions and zero-knowledge proofs. I also have broad interests in a variety of other topics. During my undergrad at the University of Zurich, I worked on computational game-theory with a specific focus on combinatorial auctions. In my Masters at Stanford I did a dual-depth specialization in AI and theoretical computer science.

<h2>Runner</h2>
I am a competitive mid-distance runner. I usually race between 800m and 5000m on the track but also run cross country and road races up to 10km. My main focus is on the 1500 and the mile. I currently mostly train with [Strava TC](http://www.stravatrackclub.com/) under Dena Evans. I am also associated with and am racing for the [Stanford Running Club](https://running.stanford.edu), [Hamburg Running](http://hamburg-running.de/) and [LC Regensdorf](http://www.lcr.ch). Feel free to add me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/12017759). My personal records are 3:51.5 for 1500m and 14:55 for 5km and 31:40 for 10km and my proudest accomplishment is winning multiple Swiss relay championships with LC Regensdorf. My short term goal is to qualify for the German national championships and long term I would like to run under 4 minutes for the mile. My main motivation though is that I enjoy running and pushing myself to my physical limits.

<h2>Traveler</h2>
I have been extremley blessed with the opportunity to travel a lot. After graduating from my Masters in the summer of 2016, I decided to fullfill a lifelong dream of mine and bike across the United States. 40 days after I had left the Bay Area I reached the White House in Washington D.C. While it was hardly a life changing spiritual experience, it was certainly an adventure. If you want to know more about it you can read my way too detailed travel journal at
[crazyguyonabike.com](https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/?o=tS&doc_id=18076&v=VC). Thanks to this bike trip and the subsequent roadtrip home I have already visited 31 states. I am planning to get all 50 by the end of my PhD so if you know a good excuse to go to Nebraska let me know. Recently, I have become an expert on whether purchasing 30 year old RVs makes sense. The answer is no.
