**Umlaute explained aka how to pronounce my name**

<br>
Bünz which is a [small river in Switzerland](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCnz) according to my dad means small fat farmer. A name with so much meaning deserves to be pronounced correctly. Unfortunately, the so called umlaut "ü" is a sound that doesn't really exist in English and despite its looks it definitley doesn't sound like a u. The international spelling of ü is ue, hence my email address and domain name: Buenz. But a ü also doesn't sound like ue. It probably most sound like "ee" but
with a rounder mouth. Just click on this [link](http://www.thegermanprofessor.com/how-to-pronounce-o-and-u/) if you actually want to learn how to pronounce it. This paragraph was brought to you by the very German need to correct people ([great Economist article on it](https://www.1843magazine.com/ideas/the-daily/being-german-is-no-laughing-matter)).

Btw if you want to write an ü it's option+u and u again on a mac or \"u in latex.

**Should I invest in Bitcoin/Ethereum etc.?**

<br>
Since about a million people have asked me this, let me publicly post my answer to this question: "No idea but if you do, do not invest more than you can absolutely afford to lose."

**Do you want to advise my new cryptocurrency project that is going to disrupt the tinder for cats space?**

Probably no.

**How to create a simple yet aesthetic website**

<br>
Same way you write any program. You copy it from some place in the internet. I read Jordi Pont-Tueset's [blog](http://jponttuset.cat/building-an-academic-website/) on building an academic website and copied his from [here](https://github.com/jponttuset/jponttuset.github.io). Feel free to also start by cloning my website from [github](https://github.com/bbuenz/bbuenz.github.io). Feel free to adapt this theme to your site without linking back to me or including a disclaimer.
